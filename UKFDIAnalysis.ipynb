    "### 1.1 Background and aims\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) voted to leave the European Union (EU) in a referendum, which is widely known as Brexit. This was followed by a period of political instability that hindered the country's economic growth. Since the vote, there have been numerous discussions about the long-term economic standing of the UK. Some experts have argued that the decrease in trading relations with the EU due to Brexit will have significant consequences for the UK's economy in the long term. Others argue that the UK's ability to set its own regulations and legislation will allow it to increase trade with the rest of the world, particularly Asia, which is increasingly seen as the centre of economic gravity. Regardless of the arguments, there has been a lot of interest in the UK's economic performance since the Brexit vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "One measure that is frequently examined and reported on in the media as a gauge of the UK's economic standing since Brexit is foreign investor sentiment, or how interested foreign investors are in continuing to invest in or have a stake in the British economy. This reflects the UK's ability to attract foreign investment, which can boost the country's business sector and productivity as well as signals foreign investors' confidence in the future of the British economy. Without foreign investment, countries may struggle to grow their economies. Examples of foreign investment include investments in factories, mergers and acquisitions, company expansion, and the purchase of shares in UK companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "While pure financial investments, such as buying shares of a FTSE 100 company or a UK-based real estate investment trust, do signal foreign investors' willingness to invest in the UK, these investments do not necessarily reflect investors' medium to long term commitment to the British economy. This is because they can sell their shares anytime on the stock exchange and may be motivated by arbitrage or speculative opportunities rather than confidence in the British economy. On the other hand, investments such as foreign direct investment (FDI) are more likely to accurately reflect foreign investors' confidence in the UK, as they involve a longer-term commitment in the economy. Examples of FDI include establishing a subsidiary or affiliate in the UK, acquiring a local company, or building a new facility or factory in the country. Therefore, this paper will focus entirely on FDI as a measure to gauge foreign investor sentiment or continued confidence in the UK economy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main aim of this paper is to investigate the shifts in foreign investor sentiment following Brexit. By analysing three measures of foreign direct investment, this paper seeks to understand the impact of Brexit on the relative attractiveness of the UK as a destination for foreign investment. This is done by comparing the UK's FDI performance to that of the EU (27 countries without the UK).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper only analyses inflow FDIs, or investments from foreign countries into the UK. Outflow FDIs, which refer to UK investments in foreign countries, are not considered as they are irrelevant to the aim of the study. The three measures discussed in this paper are  FDI position/stock, FDI flows, and FDI projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.1 FDI position/stock\n",
    "\n",
    "The FDI position is a measure of the total accumulated value of foreign investment in a country at a specific point in time. This means that it takes into account not only the initial and new investments made by foreign entities in the country, but also any divestments or sell-offs that may have occurred over the course of the investment period. For example, if Belgium has an FDI position of £100 billion in the UK, it indicates the total amount of foreign direct investment that Belgium holds in the UK at that time. If Belgium subsequently decides to divest some of its investments in the UK, the FDI position will decrease, reflecting the sale of these assets. The FDI position reflects the net value of foreign investment in the country, taking into account any changes in ownership or divestment of assets. This is an important point to consider because it provides a more comprehensive picture of the level of foreign investment in the country, including any shifts in the level of interest or commitment on the part of foreign investors. Therefore, the FDI position is given more focus as a gauge of foreign investor sentiment in this paper as it accounts for changes in ownership or divestment of assets in addition to new investments. In contrast, the other two measures discussed below do not take into account divestments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.2 FDI flows\n",
    "\n",
    "FDI flows refer to the total value of new investments made by foreign entities during a specific period of time. These investments may include new funds, reinvested earnings, and inter-company debt, according to the UK government. While FDI flows provide valuable information about the level of new investments being made in a country, it is important to note that, unlike FDI position, they do not take into account divestments or changes in overall ownership of investments. Although FDI flows do not provide a full picture of foreign investor sentiment, they are still an important measure to consider. This is because the FDI position may also be influenced by factors such as increases in the revaluation of investments, which may not necessarily reflect new investments. Additionally, the FDI position may be subject to changes in accounting methods, which can suddenly increase or decrease the valuation of existing investments without necessarily being tied to new investments or changes in asset value. In order to gain a good understanding of foreign investor sentiment, it is important to consider both the FDI position and FDI flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.3 FDI projects\n",
    "\n",
    "The measure of FDI projects used in this paper is a good addition as it indicates the number of foreign direct investment projects, which are in the form of new investments, expansions of existing investments, or mergers and acquisitions. This measure also quantifies the number of new jobs created by these projects and specifies the regions of the UK where the projects are located. An analysis of FDI projects offers a more detailed understanding of the types of foreign direct investment activities occurring in the UK, including the number of jobs created and the regions that have experienced economic growth as a result. This information can provide valuable insights into the benefits of these investments to the country.\n"

    "## 2 Dataset acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, the discussion focuses on data collections with regard to the three measures of foreign direct investment, as well as the sources from which the data are acquired.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 FDI position/stock data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for FDI position/stock is acquired from the website of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental organisation with 38 member countries, including the UK and all EU members. The OECD dataset is chosen because it contains consistent data of the UK and all EU countries. By ensuring that the methods of calculations and definitions (items that are included in the calculations) are aligned, the comparisons can be done accurately. Conveniently, the OECD also includes data of the EU 27-countries excluding the UK even for the years before Brexit, making it easy to carry out comparisons throughout the period observed. For example, it makes more sense to examine the UK's performance before Brexit relative to the EU 27 countries, rather than EU 28 countries as the latter includes the UK's figures and thus a distortion to the data. This OECD dataset includes all FDI positions for all member countries from 2005 up until 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another large dataset is acquired from the UK government's website. This dataset shows the FDI positions held by foreign countries that have invested in the UK, the corresponding amounts, and the industries that have benefited from these investments. However, this UK government dataset is significantly messier than OECD's and therefore requires more data cleaning, which is demonstrated in the next segment of the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 FDI flow data\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to FDI position, the dataset for the UK and EU (27 countries)'s FDI inflows is acquired from the OECD's website. The OECD dataset includes all FDI inflows for all member countries from 2005 up until 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 FDI project data\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no easily comparable figures or consistent data for FDI projects available. It is thus not appropriate to try to do any comparisons between the UK and EU with this measure. However, it is still worth looking at how FDI investments have benefited the UK, in terms of its regional economies and the number of jobs created. The UK government does not seem to provide any readily available csv or excel files containing multiple year data of FDI projects. Hence, it is necessary to carry out webscraping on a UK government webpage that contains most of the FDI projects data that is helpful for data analysis. The webpage being scraped is https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/department-for-international-trade-inward-investment-results-2020-to-2021/department-for-international-trade-inward-investment-results-2020-to-2021-online-version\n"

    "Let's first import the raw data for the FDI positions of OECD members. The dataset contains all FDI inward positions for all OECD members, as well as data that is grouped together for regions such as the EU, EU 27 countries, and G20 countries. However, the format is not suitable for processing, so data cleaning is needed. We start by dropping unwanted columns and rows.

    "With the data completely cleaned, we can now begin our analysis. We will look at the performances of the UK and EU (27 countries) in terms of their FDI inward positions from 2005 until 2021, and compare the figures between the two regions. The best way for us to grasp their performances is to plot the data onto a time-series-based multi-bar chart and compare the height of the bars. We are particularly interested in how the UK's performance relative to the EU (27 countries) has fared during the years before Brexit and after:"

The UK's inward FDI stock has been increasing since 2016, reaching its highest level in 2020, although it decreased slightly in 2021. This pattern is somewhat similar in the EU. Both the UK and EU have experienced robust growth in FDI positions over the years, and in the UK's case, even after the Brexit vote (2016), the FDI position growth continued robustly. To gain a clearer picture, it is worth measuring the gap between the two entities. Let's lay out a table to show the difference between the UK and EU's figures:"

    "As can be seen in the graph above, although the UK and the EU both enjoyed a significant increase in their FDI inward stocks in absolute value since 2016, the gap has widened significantly. This means the EU has experienced an even higher growth in FDI position relative to the UK. From both the bar and line charts, we can clearly see that the EU and UK performances are somewhat consistent with each other. It is thus worth plotting both data on a scatter plot to determine the direction of any potential correlation and the strength of it."

    "The slope of the UK and EU inward position regression line, which is around 30%, suggests that there is a somewhat positive relationship between the two. This is an important point to consider, as it may suggest that the EU and UK are not competitors when it comes to inward FDI. If they were competitors, their relationship would be negatively correlated, as one would gain at the expense of the other. However, the positive correlation in this case suggests that the UK and EU have both gained robustly over the period. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have looked at the performance of the UK and EU over the years, we can analyse the data further by comparing the UK to individual countries in the EU. It is worth analysing which countries in the EU currently make up the largest portion of the EU's overall inward FDI position. To do this, we will extract data for individual regions or countries for the year 2021 and sort them based on their FDI amount. By sorting the table in this way, we can easily determine which individual countries in the EU have the largest FDI positions."

    "From the bar chart, it is clear that the UK's performance relative to individual EU countries has been extremely robust. It is interesting to note that the UK's relative FDI position has significantly increased since the Brexit vote in 2016. In fact, the UK has had the largest FDI position in all years except for 2008 (during the global financial crisis) and 2021. It is also worth mentioning that the Netherlands has experienced tremendous growth in FDI since 2016 and has even overtaken the UK in 2021."

    "Let's now look at the FDI position dataset provided by the UK government. This dataset is different from the data provided by OECD. OECD's dataset focuses on comparing how much FDI investments different countries or regions hold. The UK government's focuses only on the UK's FDI position and shows which foreign countries have invested in the UK via FDI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the dataset includes a breakdown of the FDI positions, showing in which sectors the FDI positions are located. This dataset allows us to determine which foreign countries have invested the most in the UK and in which UK sectors. Now, we will begin cleaning the dataset. For this analysis, we will only focus on the years after the Brexit vote to gauge its economic impact. This dataset is messier than the OECD dataset and requires more complex data cleaning methods."

The corresponding years in the year column will be stored as sub-keys, and the corresponding values will be stored as the content in the sub-dictionary. The values are extracted using regular expression (regex) techniques so that only the relevant information is retrieved. It is important to note that once the dataset is processed using retrieveRegionFDI(), then we can easily retrieve any relevant data associated with the region that we are examining just by passing in the region or country key in the resulting dictionary that is returned by retrieveRegionFDI.

We will also drop rows related to UK offshore areas, as they are not the typical sovereign countries but rather UK crown dependencies. Our focus is on non-crown dependencies or non-offshore locations making the investments. This is because many of these investments from offshore locations are not actually investments from those countries, but rather money from other sources that is directed to offshore locations for tax efficiency purposes.\n",

In any case, they do not pose much of a problem because they relate to countries that do not hold significant investments in the UK and are therefore insignificant in our analysis. The retrieved table will be sorted according to their FDI holdings in 2017. This is helpful because it allows us to see the most significant foreign investors in terms of FDI in 2017 and how their sentiment has changed from the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote through to 2020. \n"

    "As shown in the chart, the positions of the most significant FDI investors in the UK have remained largely stable over the years, with the exception of the US. The US position has gradually increased over the years. This prompts us to analyse why the UK has experienced such significant growth and which countries have contributed to this growth in FDI positions. To gain a deeper understanding of this, it is worth analysing which foreign countries have contributed the most to the growth in FDI positions in the UK if it was not attributed to the most significant foreign countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "To carry out our analysis, we will first create a function to calculate the growth rate in the cleaned dataset. We will then use the .apply method to apply this function to the dataset, resulting in a new column with the growth rate values that correspond to the growth rate of FDI amount from 2017 to 2020."

This means that while their growth rate seems very high, their absolute FDI in the UK in 2020 (GBP 430 million and GBP 110 million, respectively) is still relatively low. This shows that they are unlikely to be significant contributors to the high growth in FDI position in the UK. \n",

Canada, Ireland, and Germany all had five-figure amounts (in million units) in 2017 and contributed to growth rates of 141.82%, 88.60%, and 59.52%, respectively. Their high growth rates, together with their already significant presence in the UK, make their contributions to the growth in FDI positions noteworthy. \n",

    "Our analysis of the UK's inward FDI position thus far has provided us with a good picture of its performance. However, it is also important to note that there have been some issues with the dataset. According to the UK government website, changes in valuation standards have caused some investments in certain industries and countries, particularly in the 2020 figures, to be \"reevaluated\" and show a significant increase in value. This means that the substantial growth we have seen in our analysis may not necessarily be a result of an actual appreciation in the value of existing assets or new investments coming into the UK. This is a limitation of only analysing FDI in both absolute and growth terms. Therefore, it is crucial that we also consider the FDI inflow, which is defined as new investments in the earlier section. We will thus turn our attention to the UK's FDI inflows.\n",

    "The chart shows a very random pattern between the UK and the EU 27 countries. Both the UK and EU have experienced significant increases and low levels of FDI inflows at different times throughout the years. In the year of the Brexit vote in 2016, the UK attracted the highest level of FDI inflows in the observed period. After that, the UK has consistently seen a decline in FDI inflows, while the EU saw a large increase in inflow in 2019, but a substantial decrease in 2020 and 2021. This unusual pattern could be attributed to the COVID pandemic. It is difficult to determine whether this is solely due to the Brexit vote. If we look at the years before the Brexit vote, there was also a similarly random pattern, with the UK sometimes falling to record low levels while the EU reached very high levels. Let's try to analyse this further.\n",

    "As discussed in the first section, there is a lack of readily available datasets provided as CSV or Excel files. For this reason, we will be scraping from the website of the UK government. First, we construct a function for web scraping. The function takes in a url input of the webpage that we want to scrape and then process it and outputs a list of all the tables that are displayed on the webpage. We will use Beautiful Soup to implement webscraping. We will then input the UK government's website url (https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/department-for-international-trade-inward-investment-results-2020-to-2021/department-for-international-trade-inward-investment-results-2020-to-2021-online-version) into the function. In the function, the tables scraped from the website are cleaned and formatted into dataframe:"

    "## 4. Flaws in UK government's dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We have gained valuable insights from the large datasets that we have obtained from the OECD and UK government websites. It is worth noting, however, that there are limitations and flaws in these datasets, particularly in the data from the UK government.\n",
    "\n",
    "The UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS), the provider of the FDI data, has implemented statistical methodology changes to its FDI calculations starting in 2020. This might have distorted our analysis involving FDI data in 2020. One of the most significant changes made was the inclusion of a larger number of companies in the FDI statistics, with the total increasing from around 29,400 to 45,500 annually. This is a large increase and could explain the substantial FDI position growth in 2020. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of the methodology changes, the ONS has urged caution when it comes to analysing the 2019 and 2020 figures. The changes might have distorted our analysis that included the years 2019 and 2020. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Ethical data acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets from both the OECD and the UK government were acquired ethically and legally. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the UK government's website, the ONS's datasets are subject to the Crown copyright protection and is published under the Open Government Licence (OGL). The OGL permits the copying, publishing, distribution and transmission of information that is under licensed. This means that the data that was scraped from the UK government's website, as well as the downloaded CSV datasets are permitted for the analysis in this paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the OECD website, the public is free to use its data. This is made clear in its stateement in the terms and conditions section of the OECD website: \"Except where additional restrictions apply as stated above, You can extract from, download, copy, adapt, print, distribute, share and embed Data for any purpose, even for commercial use. You must give appropriate credit to the OECD by using the citation associated with the relevant Data, or, if no specific citation is available, You must cite the source information using the following format: OECD (year), (dataset name),(data source) DOI or URL (accessed on (date)).\" This has been complied with in the References section of this paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen very robust growth in the UK's FDI position in the years following the Brexit vote. The analysis of this data does not suggest that foreign investors have lost confidence in the UK. However, as mentioned in Section 4, there are flaws in the FDI position data that may have distorted our analysis and exaggerated the growth we have observed. Even so, if we ignore FDI growth figures and focus solely on the absolute values, the UK's FDI position remains very large, and when compared to other EU countries, only the Netherlands has a higher FDI position than the UK. This suggests that there have not been any significant divestments by the UK's existing foreign investors following the Brexit vote and that such investors continue to hold large stakes in the economy, signalling their long-term confidence in the UK. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the UK's FDI inward positions are robust, we have seen a slowdown in growth in terms of FDI inflows. However, it is difficult to attribute this slowdown solely to Brexit, as the EU has also experienced a substantial slowdown in its FDI inflows. The COVID-19 pandemic may be a contributing factor and it is difficult to determine the extent to which Brexit has impacted the slowdown. Our analysis failed to reveal any relationship between the UK and EU in terms of FDI inflows. According to our scatter plot, there is no relationship between the UK and EU's FDI inflow figures at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also analysed FDI project figures and found that England, particularly the South East, is the largest beneficiary of FDI. The software and IT sector has been the biggest beneficiary, and the US has been the biggest contributor to the number of new jobs and projects in the UK.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, we have gained valuable insights and we can conclude that, thus far, the UK's overall FDI performance remains robust. However, further study is needed to determine with confidence whether the weakness we have seen in FDI inflow growth will persist in the future and impact the UK's FDI figures. We also need time to determine whether the weakness in the UK's FDI inflow growth is due to Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic, or a combination of both. Unfortunately, the only way to determine this is to wait for more data to become available in the coming years. This will provide us with more insights as to whether investors will remain confident in post-Brexit Britain\n",
