# Introduction
This data analysis project aims to use Python and the Pandas and Numpy libraries to investigate and analyse the changes in foreign investor sentiment towards the UK after the Brexit vote in 2016. The paper uses foreign direct investment (FDI) as a measure of foreign investor sentiment, as it reflects a longer-term commitment to the economy. The paper compares the UK's FDI performance to that of the EU (27 countries without the UK) by analysing three measures of foreign direct investment. The paper seeks to understand the impact of Brexit on the relative attractiveness of the UK as a destination for foreign investment in light of the economic instability and discussions about the long-term economic standing of the UK following the Brexit vote.
